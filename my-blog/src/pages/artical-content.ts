      `In this article, we're going to be talking looking at a very quick way
    to set up a Node.js server. Building a Node server can seem daunting, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be done in just 10 minutes. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build your own Node server quickly and easily.

    Install Node.js: The first step is to install Node.js on your computer. You can download it from the official website and follow the installation process.

    Create a folder: Create a new folder where you want to store your Node server files. You can name it anything you want.

    Open the folder in a terminal: Open the folder in a terminal or command prompt. You can use any terminal application of your choice.

    Initialize the Node project: Run the command npm init in the terminal to initialize a new Node project. This will create a package.json file in your folder.

    Install dependencies: To create a Node server, you will need to install some dependencies. Run the following command to install the required dependencies.
    npm install express`,

      `This will install the Express framework, which makes it easier to create a server.

    Create the server file: Create a new file in your folder and name it server.js. This is where you will write the code for your server.

    Write the server code: Copy the following code into server.js.

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
    });

    This code creates a basic Express server that listens on port 3000 and sends a "Hello World!" response when you visit localhost:3000 in your web browser.

    Start the server: Run the command node server.js in the terminal to start the server. You should see a message that says "Server listening on port 3000".

    That's it! You have now created a Node server in just 10 minutes. Of course, this is just a basic server, but you can build on it to create more complex applications.`,

      `Today is the day I talk about something which scares most people: resumes.
           MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. It is a document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
To get started with MongoDB, you first need to download and install it on your local machine. You can download the latest version of MongoDB from the official website. Once you have installed MongoDB, you can start the MongoDB server using the command line or a graphical user interface (GUI) such as MongoDB Compass.`,

To interact with MongoDB, you can use the MongoDB shell or one of the many available drivers and libraries for your programming language of choice. MongoDB provides drivers for several programming languages, including Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby, and C#, among others.`,
      `One of the key concepts in MongoDB is collections, which are analogous to tables in a traditional relational database. Collections can contain multiple documents, which are individual records in the database. Documents are stored in BSON format, which is a binary representation of JSON.

MongoDB supports a rich set of operations for querying and manipulating data. You can perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) as well as more complex operations such as aggregation, indexing, and transactions. MongoDB also supports a flexible data model that allows you to easily add or modify fields within a document.

Overall, MongoDB is a powerful and flexible database that is well-suited for modern web applications that require fast, scalable, and flexible data storage. With its rich set of features and easy-to-use APIs, MongoDB is a popular choice among developers for a wide range of applications.`,
